    "The notebooks in this folder contain the full script I used for the 2019 AERE workshop. There are parts of the script that I skipped in the workshop because we ran out of time, but all parts are fully functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks are currently optimized to run in the cloud on the [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) infrastructure. The benefit of this format is that it elimnates the need to install anything on your one's local machine to run the code. The drawback is that the `explore` function, enabling interactive exploration of results with a pop-up application window, doesn't work in this environment. To accomodate both the cloud environment and local machine setups, I have added a cell to the top of each notebook that contains a line\n",

Once you have done that instantiation, you should be able to just open each notebook and run the content on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To instantiate the environment defined in this repo, do the following:\n",
    "1. Start Julia\n",
    "2. Enter the package REPL mode by pressing `]`\n",
    "3. Execute `pkg> activate <FULL PATH TO THE REPO FOLDER ON YOUR SYSTEM>`, where you replace `<FULL PATH TO THE REPO FOLDER ON YOUR SYSTEM>` with the local path on your hard drive where the content of the folder for the workshop is located.\n",
    "4. Still in the package REPL, execute the following command: `pkg> instantiate`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point all Julia packages that you need should be installed.\n",

    "If you downloaded individual notebook files and not the whole repository provided here, you will need to follow the setup instructions I sent out before the workshop to install all necessary packages."
